# pykal: From Theory to Python to ROS

> _"Cross a river once, swim; cross a river twice, build a boat; cross a river thrice, build a bridge."_ > â€” old Punjabi saying

pykal is a Python development framework that bridges the chasm between theoretical control systems and their implementation in hardware. Designed for hobbyists, students, and academics alike, this framework won't cure cancer, but it can do the next best thing: make building robots easier.

To get started, or to explore what this framework has to offer, click here: [Quickstart](docs/source/quickstart_index.rst).
