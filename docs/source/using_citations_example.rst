Introduction
============

The Kalman filter :cite:`kalman1960new` is a fundamental tool in state estimation.
It provides optimal estimates for linear systems under Gaussian noise assumptions.

Implementation in pykal
=======================

Our implementation of the Kalman filter can be found in ``pykal.utilities.estimators.kf``.
The implementation follows the formulation presented in :cite:`kalman1960new`.
