======================================
 Control Systems as Dynamical Systems
======================================

    "All the world is a [dynamical system], and all the men and women merely [dynamical systems]."

    -- Shakespeare (paraphrased)
    
This section consists of three examples of using the ``pykal.DynamicalSystem`` and ``pykal.DataChange`` modules to model and simulate control systems.

"Example: Car Cruise Control" walks the reader through modeling a classic feedback system as the composition of dynamical systems. We recommended starting here.

"Example: Turtlebot with Noisy Odometry" walks the reader through modeling a simple ``ROS`` robot with realistic noisy data. 

"Example: Crazyflie Multi-Sensor Fusion" walks the reader through a more sophisticated ``ROS`` robot that integrates noisy and asynchronous data from multiple sources.
