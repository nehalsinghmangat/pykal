=================================
 Algorithms as Dynamical Systems
=================================
This section consists of two examples: casting a state estimation algorithm as a dynamical system, and casting a control algorithm as a dynamical system. The notebooks below serve as both tutorial and reference, should the reader want to implement algorithms of their own in the dynamical system format (see Contributing to the Algorithm Library).

"Example: Kalman Filter" casts the standard Kalman filter as a dynamical system.

"Example: PID Controller" casts the standard PID controller as a dynamical system.
