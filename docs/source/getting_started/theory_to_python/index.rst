==================
 Theory to Python
==================

``pykal`` uses the discrete-time dynamical system as a compositional primitive; that is, dynamical systems are the building blocks with which we implement our control systems/algorithms. 

The "Installation" section will guide you through installing the ``pykal`` package.

The "Control Systems as Dynamical Systems" section serves as a first introduction to modeling feedback systems as dynamical systems.

The "Algorithms as Dynamical Systems" section serves as a reference for how to cast control/estimation algorithms as dynamical systems.

The "Modules" section offers tips and usage examples of the ``pykal`` modules/classes used in this section: the ``pykal.DynamicalSystem`` class and the ``pykal.DataChange`` class.
