This sections consists of tips, tricks, and usage examples of the ``pykal.DynamicalSystem`` and ``pykal.DataChange`` modules. The following notebooks are a complement to the API reference and it is recommended to have both at hand (e.g. in an open tab) while you are developing with ``pykal``.

"DynamicalSystem" consists of numerous parts. Each part, roughly speaking, builds on the last, and guides the reader from an introduction to the dynamical system as a compositional primitive to the usefulnees of such a primitive in control system modeling.

"DataChange" consists of only three parts. The first part demonstrates corrupting data with common hardware-based corruptions, the second demonstrates cleaning data with common cleaning techniques, and the third presents several common scenarious and how to model them.
