================================
 Dynamical Systems as ROS Nodes
================================

This section demonstrates how to deploy the dynamical systems you created in the "Theory to Python" section as ROS2 nodes. Using the ``pykal.ROSNode`` wrapper, you can transform Python functions into ROS nodes that communicate via topics.

"Example: Turtlebot ROS Deployment" walks through wrapping the Turtlebot state estimator from the previous section as a ROS node and deploying it to subscribe to real robot topics.

"Example: Crazyflie ROS Deployment" demonstrates a more complex deployment involving multiple sensors and asynchronous data streams for the Crazyflie quadcopter.
