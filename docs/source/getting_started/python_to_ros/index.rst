=============
Python to ROS
=============
``pykal`` leverages its prior casting of algorithms as discrete-time dynamical systems by rethinking ``ROS`` node architecture as a graph of dynamical systems. 

The "Installation" section will guide you through installing ``ros2`` package.

The "Dynamical Systems as ROS Nodes" section show how the dynamical system block diagrams we created in the "Theory to Python" can be implemented as ROS nodes.

The "ROS Tips and Tricks" section serves as a reference for useful ROS commands. 

The "Troubleshooting" section offers solutions to common problems when interfacing with ROS. 

The "Modules" section offers tips and usage examples of the ``pykal.ROSNode`` and ``pykal.ros2py_py2ros`` modules.
