``pykal`` is a Python package that serves as a bridge between theoretical control/estimation algorithms and their implementation onto hardware.

To get started modeling algorithms in ``pykal``, read the "Overview" and "Theory to Python" sections. To implement these algorithms into ROS and/or Gazebo, also read the "Python to ROS" and "ROS to Gazebo" sections.
