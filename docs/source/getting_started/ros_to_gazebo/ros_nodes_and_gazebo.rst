 ROS Nodes and Gazebo
======================

This section demonstrates how to integrate the ROS nodes you created in the "Python to ROS" section with Gazebo simulation environments. By using ``pykal.gazebo`` wrappers, you can test your control systems in realistic simulated environments before deploying to hardware.

"Example: Turtlebot Gazebo Integration" shows how to modify the Turtlebot ROS node architecture to interface with a Gazebo-simulated Turtlebot, including topic remapping and simulation-specific configurations.

"Example: Crazyflie Gazebo Integration" demonstrates integrating the multi-sensor Crazyflie system with a Gazebo physics simulation, handling simulated IMU, position, and velocity data.
