This section consists of tips, tricks, and usage examples of the ``pykal.gazebo`` module. The following notebook is a complement to the API reference and it is recommended to have both at hand (e.g. in an open tab) while you are developing with ``pykal``.

"Gazebo Basics" covers the essential functions for launching and managing Gazebo simulations from within Jupyter notebooks, including starting headless simulations, setting robot poses, and cleanly shutting down simulation environments.
