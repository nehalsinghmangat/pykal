 On Building Robots
====================

I claim that building a robot requires four steps:

**Theory**. Before we can make anything more complicated than a paperclip, we need to recast our robot as a control system.

**Software**. MATLAB has been an industry standard for modeling control systems. Recently, programming languages such as Python or C++ have become increasingly popular.

**Simulation**. The world of simulation is beautiful and forgiving. When simulations fail, it is an inconvenience

**Hardware**. The world of hardware is neither beautiful nor forgiving. When hardware fails, it is a catastrophe.

Each of these domains are difficult in their own right, but it is on the bridges between them that many good men die. This is what ``pykal`` aims to fix.
