=========================
The Paradox of Complexity
=========================

Humans are masters of abstraction. It is our preferred weapon, the pointiest stick, with which we can kill the computer behind the screen, the engine under the hood, and the wiring inside the walls. This is rarely a problem; in fact, such abstractions are necessary in daily life.

But sometimes abstraction fails us. Consider the robot. When we see a humanoid cocks its head or a headless dog carry a hundred pounds, are we impressed? Yes, but not by enough. We should be jumping and shouting and falling to our knees, weeping at the marvels of modern technology; instead, we ask why the humanoid can't do a backflip or why the dog can't recognize faces. Abstraction turned what should have been a quasi-religious experience into just another Tuesday. This is tolerable most of the time, but there is one situation in which it never is: when we want to build something.

Suppose we want to build a robot. If we were hobbyists, we might want a weekend project that can clean our carpet; if we were engineers, we might want a mechanical arm to boost production; if we were academics, we might dream of a quadruped with a cannon-head to threaten the government for grant money. Regardless of context, if we want to build a robot, we cannot remain safely in the realm of abstraction. We need to get our hands dirty. We need to get our heads dirty. And we need to know how we can do both.

Alas, if only we knew how. Perhaps the next section will be illuminating?
