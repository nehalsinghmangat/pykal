===================================
Motivation: Robotics and Complexity
===================================

Humans are masters of abstraction. It is our preferred weapon, our pointiest stick, with which we slay the CPU behind the screen, the engine beneath the hood, and the wiring inside the walls. This is rarely a problem; in fact, daily living requires abstraction lest we drown in complexity. But sometimes abstraction fails us.

Suppose we want to build a robot. If we were hobbyists, we might want a weekend project; if we were engineers, we might want a mechanical arm  on the assembly line to boost production; and if we were academics, we might dream of a quadruped with a cannon-head to threaten the government for grant money. Regardless of context, if we want to build and control a robot, we cannot remain safely in the realm of abstraction. We need to get our hands dirty.
