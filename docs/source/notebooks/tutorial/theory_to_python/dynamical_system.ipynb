    "# DynamicalSystem\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DynamicalSystem` class is the foundational abstraction in `pykal` for modeling *any* control-system component (plant, controller, observer, sensor, estimator, etc.). This notebook demonstrates the core usage patterns of `DynamicalSystem` through progressively more complex examples. But first, the \"Conceptual Foundation\" section will cover the mathematical and programmatic foundation behind the `DynamicalSystem` class. **Do not skip this section**; reading it will solve a hundred problems before they start!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Foundation\n",
    "We begin with the minimal mathematics needed to define the discrete-time dynamical systems. We then introduce notational conventions and end with a Python implementation of the concepts discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete-Time Dynamical Systems\n",
    ":::{note} This is a minimal category-theoretic definition of the discrete-time dynamical system. For an intuitive overview, including how to case continous-time dynamical systems as discrete-time dynamical systems, check out [Steve Brunton's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dvF2jesB4E).\n",
    "For a reference to the category theoretic concepts needed here (which are quite minimal), check out the relevant wikipedia article on the category [$\\text{Set}$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_sets).\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the category $\\text{Set}$. Let $T \\in \\text{Set}$ where $T \\subset \\mathbb{R}^+ $ and $T$ has finite cardinality $|T| = N$. We will refer to such a set as a **time domain**. Given a time domain $T$, we may construct an **indexing set** $K=\\left\\{ 1,2,\\dots,N\\right\\}$, where $ k \\in K$ indexes elements of our time domain $T$ as $t_k$. In so doing, $T$ becomes an **indexed time domain**.\n",
    "\n",
    " Now let $X, Y, \\mathcal{M} \\in \\text{Set}$. We will refer to $X$ as the **state space**, $Y$ as the **output space**, and $\\mathcal{M}$ the **parameter space**. We place the following restriction on our choice of $X,Y$, and $\\mathcal{M}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No space in the triple $(X,Y,\\mathcal{M})$ is empty.\n",
    "- At least one space in the triple $(X,Y,\\mathcal{M})$ must have $|T| = N$ elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now construct a special function that will map a subset of $X \\times \\mathcal{M}$ with a subset of $X \\times Y$. We will call such a function a **discrete-time dynamical system.**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, consider the product $X \\times \\mathcal{M} \\times X \\times Y$. Such a product will clearly have cardinality $|X| \\cdot |\\mathcal{M}| \\cdot |X| \\cdot |Y| \\geq N$ (by the restriction above); thus, we may arbitrarily index a subset of the product $X \\times \\mathcal{M} \\times X \\times Y$ using the indexing set $K-1:=\\left\\{ 1,2,\\dots,N-1\\right\\}$ with indices $k$ as follows:\n",

    "The tuple of functions $(f,h)$ constructed above shall be referred to as a **discrete-time dynamical system**. We will refer to $f$ as our **evolution function** (or **dynamics**), and $h$ as our **output function** (or **measurement** function,  based on context). Finally, the parameter $x_k$ is often referred to as the **state** of a dynamical system, and $y_k$ is referred to as the **output** or **measurement** (again, depending on context)\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} Our evolution and output functions are *defined* by our choice of $(X,Y,\\mathcal{M})$, our choice of time domain $T$, and our choice of indexing $(x_k,\\mu_k,x_{k+1},y_k)$. Since all of these choices are arbitrary, we have defined *every possible* discrete-time dynamical system one could possible imagine (via the axiom of choice). All that is left is to implement them.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "### Simplifying Conventions\n",
    "Let $(f,h)$ be defined as above. We shall refer to the elements $(x_k,\\mu_k)$ as **parameter tuples** and the variable in each slot as **parameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(f,h)(x_k,\\mu_k)=(x_{k+1},\\mu_k)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    " then $(x_k,\\mu_k)$ is a parameter tuple and $x_k$ and $\\mu_k$ are our parameters. But if $\\mu_k = (t_k,a_k,b_k,c_k)$, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(f,h)(x_k,\\mu_k) = (f,h)(x_k,(t_k,a_k,b_k,c_k)) =: (f,h)(x_k,t_k,a_k,b_k,c_k)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so our parameter tuple is $(x_k,t_k,a_k,b_k,c_k)$ and our parameters are $x_k,t_k,a_k,b_k,$ and $c_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, we rarely discuss parameter tuples and almost exclusively focus on parameters. We will also find that the number of parameters for a given dynamical system can be considerable; therefore, we introduce the following convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that, in the example above, we decide that only the parameters $x_k$ and $t_k$ are worth explicitely writing down. Then we may write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(f,h)(x_k,t_k,a_k,b_k,c_k) = (f,h)(x_k,t_k,\\dots)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we call $x_k$ and $a_k$ **explicit parameters**, and $a_k$,$b_k$ and $c_k$ are **implicit parameters** which we infer from context (think of them as \"hiding\" in the ellipses). As a general guideline: if they exists, $x_k$ and $t_k$ should always be explicit parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} With the exception of the guideline given above, it is up to the users discretion which parameters should be explicit and which should be implicit. There is no mathematical difference or even implementation difference in Python; writing some parameters implicitly via ellipses is just a shorthand.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "### Programmatic Implementation of a Discrete-Time Dynamical System\n",
    "Recall that our discrete-time dynamical system is given by a tuple of functions $(f,h)$  subject to the restrictions previously mentioned. Often, we will refer to such a tuple $(f,h)$ as the **$(f,h)$-representation** of a discrete-time dynamical system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we discuss the `pykal.DynamicalSystem` class, or `DynamicalSystem` class, for short. The constructor for the class binds the $(f,h)$-representation of a dynamical system to a `DynamicalSystem` object.\n",

    "As you have likely noticed, although mathematically the parameters for $f$ and $h$ are the same, programmatically `f` and `h` declare different parameters. What is happening is that the `.step(params=Dict)` method has a common `params` dictionary, and relevant parameters for either `f` or `h` are routed internally. This is very convenient if parameters are duplicated across functions and makes for more readable code.\n"

   "source": "#### The `_smart_call` Function\n\nUnder the hood, the `.step()` method uses a static method called `_smart_call()` to route parameters from the shared `params` dictionary to the appropriate function arguments. This function inspects the signature of `f` or `h`, extracts only the parameters each function needs from the dictionary, and calls the function with those parameters.\n\nWhile `_smart_call()` is used internally by `.step()`, advanced users can call it directly when implementing complex algorithms. For example, the [Kalman Filter implementation](../../algorithm_library/kf_pykal.ipynb) uses `_smart_call()` within its own `f` function to invoke the plant's evolution and measurement functions with the correct parameters.\n\nFor technical details on how parameter binding works, see the [API reference for `_smart_call`](../../api/dynamical_system.rst#pykal.DynamicalSystem._smart_call).",
