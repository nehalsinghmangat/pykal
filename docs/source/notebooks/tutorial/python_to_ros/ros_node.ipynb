The callback function receives the current time in seconds (tk) as the first argument and the subscribed topics as keyword arguments. Under the hood, these topics are converted to numpy arrays which are sent to wrapped dynamical system. After the system is stepped, the output is then put into a dictionary which maps the output to the topic name it should be published to.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Topics** (pub/sub): asynchronous message streams (`/cmd_vel`, `/odom`, `/imu/data`, …)\n",
    "- **Services** (req/rep): synchronous RPC calls (`/reset`, `/calibrate`, …)\n",
    "- **Actions** (goal/feedback/result): long-running tasks (navigation goals, trajectories, …)\n",

    "1. **Subscribe** to one or more input topics\n",
    "2. **Convert** incoming messages into an internal representation\n",
    "3. **Compute** something (control, filtering, fusion, transforms, etc.)\n",
