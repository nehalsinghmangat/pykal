    "This notebook serves as both a tutorial and template for implementing control algorithms as dynamical systems using pykal. The title of the notebook should be the name of the algorithm. The text beneath the title should serve as a general overview of your algorithm, including links to useful materials. If your algorithm is included in the `pykal.algorithm_library`, then include a link to the API reference. We give an example below.\n",

    "The PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is one of the most widely used feedback control algorithms in industrial and robotics applications. This controller adjusts a control input based on three terms to achieve desired system behavior: proportional response to current error, integral action to eliminate steady-state error, and derivative action for damping. For further information, read the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller). For the classic paper on PID tuning, see [Ziegler and Nichols (1942)](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.3662552).\n",

    "## Notes on Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides practical guidance on when and how to use the PID controller implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use This Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The PID controller is appropriate when **most** of the following conditions hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single-input single-output (SISO) system**: PID works best for controlling one output with one input\n",
    "2. **Stable or marginally stable plant**: The open-loop system should not be highly unstable\n",
    "3. **Smooth dynamics**: The plant responds reasonably to control inputs without excessive delays\n",
    "4. **Measurement availability**: The output (or an estimate) can be measured frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "If your system is **multivariable (MIMO)**, consider using LQR, MPC, or decoupled PID loops. If your system has **significant nonlinearities**, consider gain scheduling, adaptive control, or nonlinear control methods. For **optimal control** with constraints, use MPC instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The PID controller is widely used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Industrial process control**: Temperature, pressure, flow, level control\n",
    "- **Robotics**: Motor speed/position control, altitude control for drones\n",
    "- **Automotive**: Cruise control, engine control\n",
    "- **HVAC systems**: Temperature and humidity regulation\n",
    "- **Manufacturing**: CNC machines, assembly line automation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuning Guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of the PID controller depends critically on the gain selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proportional gain $K_P$**: Larger values \u2192 faster response but more overshoot and oscillations\n",
    "- **Integral gain $K_I$**: Larger values \u2192 faster steady-state error elimination but more overshoot and potential instability\n",
    "- **Derivative gain $K_D$**: Larger values \u2192 more damping and reduced overshoot but amplifies measurement noise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuning methods**:\n",
    "- **Ziegler-Nichols**: Use step response or ultimate gain method (see [original paper](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.3662552))\n",
    "- **Cohen-Coon**: Better for systems with dead time\n",
    "- **Manual tuning**: Start with $K_I = K_D = 0$, increase $K_P$ until oscillations, then add $K_D$ for damping and $K_I$ to eliminate offset\n",
    "- **Model-based**: If plant model is known, use pole placement or optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical tips**:\n",
    "- Start conservative (low gains) and increase gradually\n",
    "- Tune one parameter at a time (P, then D, then I)\n",
    "- Use derivative filtering or measurement filtering to reduce noise sensitivity\n",
    "- Consider anti-windup schemes for integral term when saturation occurs\n",
    "\n",
    "For a practical guide to PID tuning, see [this tutorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller#Manual_tuning).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "**State representation**: The controller state is a tuple `(e_k, I_k, e_{k-1})` where:\n",
    "- `e_k`: current tracking error\n",
    "- `I_k`: accumulated integral\n",
    "- `e_{k-1}`: previous error for derivative\n",
    "\n",
    "**Controller inputs**: The controller requires:\n",
    "- `rk`: reference signal (setpoint)\n",
    "- `xhat_k`: measured or estimated plant output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Derivative on measurement**: This implementation computes the derivative on the error. An alternative is to compute the derivative on the measurement only (to avoid derivative kick when setpoint changes). This can be implemented by modifying the `h` function to use `-(xhat_k - xhat_{k-1})` instead of `(e_k - e_{k-1})`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anti-windup**: This basic implementation does not include anti-windup protection. For systems with control input saturation, consider adding integral clamping or back-calculation to prevent windup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filtering**: For noisy measurements, consider low-pass filtering the derivative term or using a filtered derivative approximation."

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated the implementation of the PID controller as a `DynamicalSystem` in pykal. The key steps were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mathematical formulation**: Defined the discrete-time PID control law with proportional, integral, and derivative terms\n",
    "2. **Algorithm definition**: Specified the error computation, integral update, and control output\n",
    "3. **Dynamical system representation**: Expressed the PID controller as state evolution `f` and output `h` functions\n",
    "4. **Implementation**: Implemented the algorithm with clear parameter handling\n",
    "5. **Example**: Validated the implementation on a first-order system tracking problem with step changes in the setpoint\n",
    "6. **Tuning**: Applied Ziegler-Nichols tuning rules for gain selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting implementation is available in `pykal.algorithm_library.controllers.pid` and can be composed with plant models and observers for complete feedback control systems."
