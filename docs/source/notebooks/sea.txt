# Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a state manifold, let
# $Y \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ be a measurement manifold, and let
# $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^p$ be a parameter manifold in which
# $X$ is embedded. A discrete-time dynamical system is the tuple
# $(f, h)$, where $f$ is an evolution function
# $f : \mathcal{M} \to X$ defined by $x_{k+1} = f(\mu)$, and
# $h$ is an output (measurement) function
# $h : \mathcal{M} \to Y$ defined by $y = h(\mu)$.
#
# Since $X$ is embedded in $\mathcal{M}$, the state $x_k$ is
# implicit in $\mu$, which is why $x_{k+1}$ is well-defined in the
# evolution function (this embedding formalism is not standard among roboticists, but it is used in differential topology and will induce a particularly nice software API in the following section).
