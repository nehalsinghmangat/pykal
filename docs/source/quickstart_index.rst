Quickstart
==========
If you are new to ``pykal``, I highly recommend reading all sections in :doc:`background <background/index>` to build an intuition behind how this framework works.

To be clear, ``pykal`` is not a package in itself; rather, ``pykal`` refers to the framework which is composed of **two** packages:  :doc:`pykal_core <./pykal_core/index>` and :doc:`pykal_ros <./pykal_ros/index>`. After working through the tutorials (and reviewing the third-party software `Gazebo <https://gazebosim.org/>`_ if needed), you will be able to start designing your own control systems and implementing them in hardware.

The above paragraph should take the average person six seconds to read. In that time, if you were new to ``pykal` you could have clicked on :doc:``background <background/index>` to build an intuition behind how this framework works.
