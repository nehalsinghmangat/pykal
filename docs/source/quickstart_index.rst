Quickstart
==========

This page contains a link to everything you need to get started using the ``pykal`` framework, including the motivation behind the creation of this package, what problems it addresses, and how it addresses them.  It contains links to topics, in order, designed to get you moving as quickly as possible.

It starts with the motivation behind the package, an installation pykal_core and quickstart tutorial of pykal_core, an installation and quickstart of pykal_ros (including a docker version deployable on any compute), and finally the turtlebot demo shown in the introduction. At that point, you will have the tools t odo this yourself.
