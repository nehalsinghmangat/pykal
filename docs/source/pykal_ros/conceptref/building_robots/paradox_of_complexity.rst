The Paradox of Complexity
=========================

Building a robot is impossible. So impossible, in fact, that it almost seems easy. When we see a humanoid jump from one platform to another, or a mechanical dog carry a hundred pounds on its back, the average person is impressed only a moment before they wonder why the humanoid can't do a backflip or the dog recognize faces. Surely the scientists and engineers who designed these systems could have spent an extra hour or so implementing these features.

The more complex a system, the more complete our abstraction of it and, paradoxically, the simpler it seems. This phenomena is not unique to robots: even those of us who are technically literate often forget the computer behind the screen or the engine beneath the hood. We are fortunate that such simplifications rarely, if ever, pose a problem in our daily lives. But there is one situation in which it is always troublesome: when we want to build a complex system ourselves.
