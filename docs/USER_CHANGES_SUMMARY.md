# Summary of User Changes

## Documentation Structure Changes

### 1. Restructured Table of Contents (`docs/source/index.rst`)

**Before:** Single flat section with "Contents" caption

**After:** Three organized sections:
```rst
Quick Start
├── Getting Started
└── Algorithm Library

The pykal Pipeline
├── What is pykal?
├── Theory to Software
├── Software to Simulation
└── Simulation to Hardware

Examples & Reference
├── Robot Examples
└── License
```

**Impact:**
- Improved discoverability with clear user journey
- Algorithm Library promoted to "Quick Start" section
- Logical grouping of pipeline concepts vs. examples

---

### 2. Simplified Introduction (`docs/source/introduction.rst`)

**Removed:**

## Major Content Addition

### 4. Complete Thermal Control Tutorial (`control_algorithms_as_dynamical_systems.rst`)

**Added ~400 lines** of comprehensive tutorial content showing:

#### Part 1: Simple Setpoint Generator
- Mathematical formulation of discrete-time thermostat
- State update equation: `x_{k+1} = f(x_k, u_k) = x_k + u_k`
- Implementation using `pykal.DynamicalSystem`
- Simulation example with step-by-step execution

#### Part 2: Closed-Loop Thermal Control System

Complete working example with **four components:**

1. **Plant: Temperature Dynamics**
   ```python
   T_{k+1} = T_k + (Δt/τ) * (-(T_k - T_env) + K_heater * u_k)
   ```
   - First-order thermal system
   - Environmental temperature influence
   - Heater input control

2. **Observer: Scalar Kalman Filter**
   - Full predict-update cycle
   - State estimation with uncertainty (P_k)
   - Gaussian noise handling (process + measurement)

3. **Controller: PID Controller**
   ```python
   u_k = K_p * e_k + K_i * I_k + K_d * D_k
   ```
   - Proportional, Integral, Derivative control
   - State vector: [I_k, e_{k-1}]
   - Acts on estimated temperature

4. **Full Simulation Loop**
   - 300-step closed-loop simulation
   - Logging of true temperature, estimated temperature, and control signals
   - Visualization code with matplotlib

**Pedagogical Approach:**
- Starts simple (setpoint generator only)
- Builds complexity incrementally
- Shows mathematical formulation → software implementation
- Complete, runnable code examples
- Demonstrates pykal's compositional philosophy

**Impact:**
- Provides concrete, executable example
- Demonstrates all key pykal concepts in one place

extensions = [
    # ... existing extensions ...
    "sphinxcontrib.bibtex",  # Bibliography support
]
```

**Added Configuration:**
```python
bibtex_bibfiles = ["references.bib"]
bibtex_default_style = "plain"
bibtex_reference_style = "author_year"

html_css_files = ["css/bibliography.css"]
html_js_files = ["js/bib_metadata.js", "js/bibliography.js"]
```

**Impact:**
- Enables Algorithm Library functionality
- Integrates custom bibliography filtering system
- Loads necessary CSS/JS for interactive features

---

### 6. Updated Dependencies (`pyproject.toml`)

**Added to `docs` extras:**
```python
"sphinx-autodoc-typehints>=1.24.0",
"sphinxcontrib-bibtex>=2.5.0",
```

**Impact:**
- Ensures bibliography system works in any environment
